*First place project for Fall 2019 ACM Ignite*

**AR Sphere** is a free-to-play, global augmented reality playground for mobile devices.

This repository features the server that empowers the [mobile application](https://github.com/EdwardGarmon/ARSphere).

## About
AR Sphere was completed as a semester-long team entreprenuerial project for ACM Ignite. Our project competed against four other teams working on different applications and business ventures.

**Augmented Reality** is a rapidly emerging technology...
- $198,000,000,000 — Projected market worth by 2025.
- 1,500,000,000 — AR-capable devices in 2019.
- 67% — Advertising executives looking to use AR more.

Our goal was to bridge over a fun, engaging user experience with the immense interest and potential for AR as a marketing tool.

Our main user experience is a simple three-step process:
1. Discover — Enter a virtual world filled with user-placed and generated 3D models.
2. Collect — Add new 3D models to your collection through discovery and promotional events.
3. Contribute — Place your own 3D models anywhere you go for others to see.

Partnering companies can pay us to proliferate custom 3D models as a promotional event to this virtual world across the globe, integrating their advertisement into the flow of the user experience.

In the future, AR Sphere has the potential to grow into a universal deployment platform for interactive AR experiences, providing corporations with the ability to focus on creating their unique AR experience opposed to the complex deployment and delivery process.

## About the Server
AR Sphere's server is built with C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and SignalR. With these technologies, our server is capable of streaming continuous data and realtime updates to users, allowing them a more natural experience when searching for models wherever they go.
